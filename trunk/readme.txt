WP Medium Editor replace the default wordpress text editor with medium editor.

 
== Description ==

 WP Medium Editor is for those who love a simple interface to write with. It stripped most  non-essential parts of what is present in the default editor. 

 An important note though: If your writing involves creating tables and some other powerful editing -  WP Medium Editor is not for you. 

 If all you do is using Bold, Italic, underline and some light weight editing. You are welcome to use this plugin.      


 
== How to Start ==
 
1. Upload the entire `WP-Medium-Editor` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click `Add new` under post. 
4. Start writing with the new interface :)
