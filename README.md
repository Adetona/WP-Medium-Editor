== Description ==

 WP Medium Editor is for those who love a simple interface to write with. It stripped most non-essential part of what is present in the default editor. 

 An important note though: If your writing involves creating tables and some other powerful editing -  WP Medium Editor is not for you. 

 If all you do is using Bold, Italic, underline and some light weight editing. You are welcome to use this plugin.
